# Mass_Emailling_using_AWS-lambda
Mass emailing with AWS Lambda and Amazon SES allows you to send emails at scale efficiently. Lambda triggers, such as S3 file uploads or CloudWatch schedules, execute functions that send emails via SES. It's a cost-effective, serverless solution, ideal for large-scale email campaigns where you pay only for the resources and time used.
